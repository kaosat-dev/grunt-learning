This is a list of all the things that need figuring out:
========================================================

 - running tests jasmine-node, possible headless testing/ travis ci like continuous integration
 - minifying / clean build
 - release circle : bump version number for node , bower etc, git tags etc
 - coffeescript support for code & tests
 - browserify support (with external && require support)
 - builds for npm, bower (depending on cases)
 - polymer build
 - node webkit build
